       <p>My name is CJ Apolinario and my hobby are eating, listening to music, doing outdoor activities, and many more.
          I was born on 25th of September 2006. I went to elementary school at Do√±a Basilisa Yangco Elementary School and
          I spent my junior high at Isaac Lopez Integrated School.</p>

       <p>Furthermore, when I entered senior high, the strand I took was Accountancy, Business and Management. For the reason 
          that I want to learn basic skills about business.</p>

       <p> My skills are cooking, dancing, being adaptive, communicating, and much more. In addition, I love
          going to parties even if it's birthday party or other kind of party.<p/>
